# Cruise Ships

I completed this guided project using JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a part of Command Shift bootcamp. I wrote the unit tests using Jest.

Features:
- Users can create a series of ports via an HTML form.
- The ship can set sail and dock at different ports.
- Information about the current port and next port is updated in the browser as the ship moves.
- The "Add" button is disabled when the "Set Sail!" button is clicked for the first time. 
- The "Set Sail!" button is disabled whilst the ship is moving between ports.
